Full Stack Web Application for Course Management

This application was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) as a portfolio project to showcase Full Stack web development skills.

Key features include:
- Responsive user interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices;
- Global state management with Redux for greater data efficiency and control;
- Light/dark theme implemented using styled-components and CSS-in-JS techniques, enabling flexible UI customization;
- Secure authentication with advanced password encryption;
- Email sending functionality via a contact form integrated with the back-end;
- Dedicated admin panel for creating, editing, and deleting courses dynamically;
- Custom animated transitions for smooth navigation between pages;
- Real-time database integration to display available courses;
- Scalable and secure architecture designed for easy maintenance and future project expansion;

Instructions:
- Replace env examples files with the correct values;
- Add an ssl folder in the root of the project directory containing the following files: dev-cert.pem and dev-key.pem. (Recommend mkrect development certificate for consistency with the Vite plugin and the mkrect dependency in the frontend.)
- Use npm run build to install all dependencies, then npm run start to launch the backend in production mode
