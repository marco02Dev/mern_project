This project, part of my portfolio as a full-stack web developer and currently under development, is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack. It combines a fully responsive frontend developed with React and a backend powered by Node.js and Express.

The application features an email-sending system via a contact form and a secure authentication system based on the Passport Local strategy, with password encryption to ensure user data protection.

Data management is handled through MongoDB, making this project suitable for modern, scalable, and security-oriented web solutions.
